              <h3>COM1001 - Introduction to Software Engineering</h3>
              <p>This module introduces the Software Engineering concepts that are needed to develop software systems that can meet basic functional requirements within a given problem domain. It covers the main steps in the process of developing such systems, from requirements analysis through to their implementation and testing. A major part of the module involves students working in teams to develop a web-based software system, which gives practical experience in teamwork and managing software projects and their products.</p>

              <h3>COM1002 - Foundations of Computer Science</h3>
              <p>The course consists of (around) 10 blocks of 2-3 weeks work each. Each block develops mathematical concepts and techniques that are of foundational importance to computing. Lectures and problem classes will be used. The intention is to enthuse about these topics, to demonstrate why they are important to us, to lay the foundations of their knowledge and prepare students for future computing courses. It is not expected that the course will cover ALL of the maths that is needed later either in terms of depth or scope.</p>

              <h3>COM1003 - Java Programming</h3>
              <p>This module introduces programming concepts through the Java programming language. Program design and the use of testing to drive program creation are also covered. Initial focus is placed on the structured aspects typical of many programming languages: the ideas of a sequence, selection and repetition. The object-oriented approach to building large software systems from components is then presented. Throughout the module, emphasis is placed on the practice of writing well-structured and readable programs to solve problems.</p>

              <h3>COM1005 - Machines and Intelligence</h3>
              <p>This module provides an introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and to key concepts and problems in the field, such as whether a computer is capable of understanding, and whether humans should themselves be viewed as machines. It also provides a brief historical overview of the subject and reviews the state-of-the-art and open questions in some of the major sub-areas of AI, pointing out connections to research work in the Department. As well as providing a first encounter with the main issues that underlie attempts to create Artificial Intelligence, the module also has a more practical component that introduces algorithms and data structures for AI problem solving through practical programming examples, as well as hands-on experience with simple programming of robots</p>
